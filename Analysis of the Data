Three Observable Trends:
  1. Looking at the Temperature v. Latitude graph, it does make sense that there is a negative correlation
     between the two variables; the temperature decreases as the latitude increases.  I did notice how there 
     are more data points in the latitudes that coorelate with North America and Europe.  This doesn't necessarly
     mean that the sample isn't representative of the overall dataset.  The global south doesn't have near the amount
     of land mass that the global north has, therefore it is logical that there are less cities.
     
  2.  There doesn't seem to be any real relationship between cloudiness and latitude.  There are very straight
      horizontal lines throughout the graph, but there are too many data points in random areas to give the lines
      any relavence.
      
  3.  It was curious that although there was a negative relationship between temperature and latitude, there seemed 
      to be a cluster of data in the top right corner of the humidity v latitude graph.  I usually associate humidity
      and heat with one another.  It does however make sense that there isn't a explicit relationship, positive,
      or negative between Humidity and Latitude, due to air streams, ocean currents, and topigraphical features,
      obviously there won't always be high humidity where there are higher temperatures.
